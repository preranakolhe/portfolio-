Portfolio Of Software Testing 

About me 
I am looking forward to working in an organization, that provides the environment for growth with competent and strong leaders in Manual and Automation Testing. Having experience in Functional and non-functional, Ul Testing, API Testing, Web-service Testing using TESTNG and Automation Testing (Selenium Web-driver with JAVA). I have an urge and inclination for learning new technologies, a strong work ethic combined with a commitment to excellence in all projects undertaken. I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Graduation Degree from the University of SNDT Pune and have experience for 3 years in the export textile industries, Ahmedabad. Now, I wish to exploit my analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal.
